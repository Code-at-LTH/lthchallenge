Your solutions are programs that will be automatically tested by the judge server **[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com)**. For a given problem the testserver will test your program on a set of some secret inputs, and your solution will be considered correct if it produces the correct output within a given time limit of the problem.

You participate with your own laptop. Power sockets will be provided.

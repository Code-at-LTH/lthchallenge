## General information
You will be given a set of problems that you will try to solve as many as possible of as fast as possible. Your solutions are programs that will be automatically tested by the judge server **[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com)**. For a given problem the testserver will test your program on a set of some secret inputs, and your solution will be considered correct if it produces the correct output within a given time limit of the problem.

You participate with your own laptop. Power sockets will be provided.

The contest will test your programming skills, and your ability to solve algorithmic problems.

LTH Challenge 2020 is part of the 2020 **[Swedish Coding Cup](http://codingcup.se/)**.

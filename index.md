LTH Challenge is an induvidual programming competition aimed towards university and
highscool students.

You will be given a set of problems that you will try to solve as many as possible of
as fast as possible. Your solutions are programs that will be automatically tested by a test
server. For a given problem the testsetver will test your program on a set of some secret inputs,
and your solution will be considered correct if it produces the correct output within a given 
time limit of the problem.

You participate with your own laptop. Power sockets will be provided.

The contest will test your programming skills, and your ability to solve algoritmic problems.

2017 is the first year we run this contest, and it will continue yearly.

LTH Challenge 2017 will be the second contest in the **[Swedish Coding Cup](http://codingcup.se/)**
